This Python package makes use of the exhaustive RESTful Web service API that has been implemented for the CellBase database.

It enables researchers to query and obtain a wealth of biological information from a single database saving a lot of time.

Another benefit is that researchers can easily make queries about different biological topics and link all this information together as all information is integrated.

Currently Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and a total of 48 species are available and many others will be included soon.
